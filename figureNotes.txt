	Training XOR, each iteration uses the 4 combinations with their correct outputs.

	Very interesting, here we can see that the smaller learning rates are slowly improving (their error is decreasing) but at a very low pace, if we kept going for more iterations they would get closer to some of the best ones (0.5, 0.75, 1 and even 1.5).

	However, we can see that the highest ones (1.75 and 2), start pretty fast but end up stuck probably still going down but overshooting the minimum.
